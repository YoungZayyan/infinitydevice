The text in its current form is inspired by Battlestar Galactica, a television show which deals heavily with concepts of identity and the effects of time.

A story is data, it can be read as a series of sequential characters, groups of paragraph strings in an array, or perhaps something more complex. As the story progresses there will be many branches, and events that can cascade through myltiple storylines. 

I am curious to see how such a freeform of storytelling can be indexed and accessed. The most basic being to surface a certain story based on the readers responses. Even more interesting would be to have the story 'generate' based on the season, the location from which accessed, even currently trending news reports on the internet.
