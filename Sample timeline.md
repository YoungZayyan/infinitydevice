New Gods Timeline
=================
























2013
----
Individuals have already begun their transformations into 'corporations of one' as continued intense perceived competitive and economic pressure force individuals to differentiate and build new markets to survive.

These corporations form networks, people exchanging time and resources freely to optimize resource consumption and generation.

Alternative currencies begin to gain widespread awareness and slight traction as people opt to avoid the lack of agency and transmutability provided by traditional currency systems.

Distrust of the government and large corporations begins to forment as leaks continue to demonstrate a lack of privacy for end users and transparency for system controllers.

Socioeconomically fragile governments with educated populaces continue crumbling, war rages on, and still brews, as the arab spring movements continue in the background. The fear and mistrust among groups of people and religious hardliners being a major hurdle to rebuilding unified governments.

Government agencies begin to understand their helplessness in the face of connected populations. They may be noticing the earth shattering shockwave of the distributed economy making its way towards humanity. They are scared.


2018
----
A government crackdown on a popular currency hub due to facilitating child porn, terrorism, and drug transactions goes disastrously as the funds of many people are frozen, tensions rise to a boiling point as the goverment arrests hundreds of people around the world on these charges.

The uproar becomes deafening as word gets around that the government had been watching and waiting for years to crack down.

International cooperation on digital security issues becomes a major point of contention in diplomatic relations. First world governments are seen taking keen interest in the development of internet protocols for disenfranchised populations. The term 'Digital colonization' is born.

In the meantime, net neutrality is sidestepped as service providers such as facebook and google excercise their unmitigated power at the behest of the government to surface approved content more efficiently and actively to supress antisocial content. A consumer dark web forms.

2025
----
Continued bitter cyberwarfare, IP theft, and outages have forced people to abandon the wild west of the open internet to instead form darknet clusters (such as Mcafee's proposed NSA blocking tool) that accept only certain types of internet interactions. The graphical intensity of the web continues to diminish in importance.

Police forces continue their relentless enforcement actions, prisons swell and transform as innocence becomes impossible to prove in a time of surveillance ubiquity. Protests continue and remain bloody. Domestic terrorism begins to march toward its crescendo.

2030
----
Individual power is simply too much for governments and corporations to challenge. The old systems are consumed through economic means as the unbridled prosperity of the new gods, the ubermensch, continues to spread.

2045
----
Inequality begins to be erased as more and more humans transcend to become new gods, keepers of the archetype. Still, uncertainty is in the air, as old enemies and new troubles brew. 

2070
----
The ascendance of machines dawns upon us. The singularity has come and gone, while the idea of what makes a human is thrown further into confusion. Pain, fear, resentment, they all build.

2075 
----
The promise of the new gods loses its lustre, as conflict is rejoined. The machines and true ubermensch ascend to the stars. The meek inherit the earth and the ubermensch will not see their folly until it is too late.

2544
----
First contact with mind virus primae eradicates 30% of sentient existence.

2546

2030
----
All out war between the government and the anarchists continues. The government is massively outnumbered, but the efficiency of media brainwashing techniques on local populations is so high that all logical arguments are indeed invalid. Fundamentalism and government converge as apocalypse loving fundamentalists are fielded through back channels to fight anarchists openly and challenge government troops internally. Fundamentalists are the lynchpin of humanity.

2045
----
A new religion forms, the ubermensch oriented anarchists concede their point and embrace the unity of the divine light. Humans rally together, but the automation of war leaves many wondering if winning the hearts and minds of the enemy even matters anymore.

Though diminished in many parts of the world, war rages on as the original macro entities fight for their very survival. Biomechanical weaponry is taken to horrifying new avenues.

2055
----
Automation is pushed to its limits. The dawn of machinekind spreads its light as robots and cyborgs begin to suffer puzzling command disconnects and malfunctions. A new being gestates in the static.

2060
----
The machine prophets are born. Despite many claims of machines somehow helping people through strange butterfly effect command patterns, first contact is initiated when an entire lost drone armada returns in a new, almost biological form.

2065
----
The human element seems to still be the hardest to understand, as rogue cyborgs and soliders, haunted and posessed by the god of war continue to fight for a reality, a god, that never really existed. Other human elements remain distrustful of the machine prophets, while others worship them. The majority of humans, however, try and build a life without conflict. The collective psyche still bears a terrible scar. The wanderers continue roaming.


2090
----
Human and machine cooperation continues, the first half human, half machine child is born. A new age of prosperity dawns upon us.
